# **Flappy Bird** in Vertical Orientation. **Nintendo 3DS**

![Game Banner](/assets/banner_page.png)  

Yet another "**Flappy Bird**" mobile game homebrew recreation for Nintendo 3DS (old/new)  
Made in **vertical orientation**, like the original game. I didn't find any port for 3DS in this format, so I decided to make it by myself. This is my first homebrew game ever, and first project in C too. I hope you will have fun with it.

## Game

*   **Tap bottom screen** or **press D-PAD or B** to flap between the pipes.
*   Game's speed is increasing for each score point.
*   For every 25 points you will earn a new medal - **bronze, silver, gold and platina** for 99 score.
*   Your best score is save in game and stored at path: SD:/config/millkeny/flappy.dat. You also can clear your save data from in-game menu.
  
*   There is no sound yet, but I will add it in future updates!
*   Night mode will be added soon too!
