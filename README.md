# **Flappy Bird** in Vertical Orientation. **Nintendo 3DS**

Yet another "**Flappy Bird**" mobile game homebrew recreation for Nintendo 3DS (old/new)  
Made in **vertical orientation**, like the original game. I didn't find any port for 3DS in this format, so I decide to make it by myself. This is my first homebrew game ever, and first project in C ever. I hope you will have fun with it.

### Game

*   **Tap bottom screen** or **press D-PAD or B** to flap between the pipes.
    
*   For every 25 points you will earn a new medal - **bronze, silver, gold and platina** for 99 score
    
*   Your best score is save in game and stored at path: SD:/config/millkeny/flappy.dat
    
*   There is no sound yet, but I will add it in future updates!

### How to Play

Just run **.3dsx** from releases page on your hacked 3DS (Homebrew Launcher) or use an emulator!  
Or you can build the project by yourself: Install [devkitPro](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases) and "make" the project. Search internet for more!
